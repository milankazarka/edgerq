# edgerq

The edgerq tool kit makes it easy to create reverse tunnels and simple overlay networks running through UDP without any complex set-up and access different types of TCP-based services anywhere - be it in a locally hosted infrastructure without a public IP and/or to further route requests to systems that would otherwise not be able to serve these requests.
